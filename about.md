I am an evolutionary botanist, who studies why species diversify. I use phylogenetic data and comparative methods to understand how biodiversity is generated and maintained across space and time.  My name is Martha Kandziora and currently, I am a Marie-Curie Widening Fellow at the Botany Department of Charles University - Prague - Czech Republic working with [R. Schmickl](https://lab-allience.natur.cuni.cz/plantevocytogen/people-research) and [Filip Kolář](https://botany.natur.cuni.cz/ecolgen/filip-kolar).

I develop tools and workflows to increase reproducibility in research. Phylogenetic relationships of species are important if we want to study the diversification of lineages and the relations to ecological niches, biogeography and traits. I developed a tool to [automatically update alignments based on custom sampling strategies](https://github.com/mkandziora/PhylUp/tree/master). Colleagues and me also developed a [python tool](https://github.com/McTavishLab/physcraper) to easily and automatic update phylogenies using OpenTreeOfLife. Currently under development are workflows to analyze the climatic conditions of areas.

A new form of analysis method to understand the dynamics of diversification within the tropical alpine was developed during my [Afroalpine dating project](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2112737119).




Besides, I have extensively using, testing and expanding usablity of a set of scripts developed by [T. Fer](https://github.com/tomas-fer/HybPhyloMaker) and wrote a guideline on how to handle target enrichment data for [recent radiations](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2021.765719/full).

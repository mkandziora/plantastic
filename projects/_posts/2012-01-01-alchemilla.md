Do dwarf shrubs show higher speciation rates compared to their closely related non-woody species?  The dwarf shrub habit is an adaptation to alpine-like environments. I was able to show, that non-woody species of  African *Alchemilla* evolved the dwarf shrub habit at least twice and that this is connected to the colonization of alpine-like environments. Nevertheless, the evolution of the dwarf shrub habit did not increase the diversification rate of these lineages ([Gehrke et al. 2015](https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/117/1/121/2195968)).
